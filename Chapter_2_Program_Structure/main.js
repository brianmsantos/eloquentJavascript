// When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

//2nd needs a conditional statemment to check which numbers are divisible by 3, 5, and both 3 and 5
//3rd anything that is not divisible by 3, 5, or both must console log the number using concatenation
